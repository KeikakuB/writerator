text-scanner
============

text-scanner is an application (GUI and command line)  which scans through text files containing text written in human languages and computes information such as the most common words used, the Gunning-Fog Index, the word count and more. text-scanner is meant to be used by people who wish to know more about the texts they read and write in order to improve their writing ability and perhaps help others as well.
