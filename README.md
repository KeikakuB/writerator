text-scanner
============

text-scanner is a command line application which analyzes plain text files containing english language writing and acquires information about them. It can also analyze a text and build new texts from the source material, such as haikus and poems.

It grants the curious user with many tools to find specific information about their texts such as number of times "I" appears or the words in a text sorted by how many times "e" appears in them.

It also allows "get the job done" type of users to retrieve more general information such as the most common words used, the Gunning-Fog index, the word count and many more.

If you like enjoy writing and programming then you should give text-scanner a shot!
